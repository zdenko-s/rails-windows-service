//
//   FUNCTION: CSampleService::OnStart(DWORD, LPWSTR *)
//
//   PURPOSE: The function is executed when a Start command is sent to the 
//   service by the SCM or when the operating system starts (for a service 
//   that starts automatically). It specifies actions to take when the 
//   service starts. In this code sample, OnStart logs a service-start 
//   message to the Application log, and queues the main service function for 
//   execution in a thread pool worker thread.
//
//   PARAMETERS:
//   * dwArgc   - number of command line arguments
//   * lpszArgv - array of command line arguments
//
//   NOTE: A service application is designed to be long running. Therefore, 
//   it usually polls or monitors something in the system. The monitoring is 
//   set up in the OnStart method. However, OnStart does not actually do the 
//   monitoring. The OnStart method must return to the operating system after 
//   the service's operation has begun. It must not loop forever or block. To 
//   set up a simple monitoring mechanism, one general solution is to create 
//   a timer in OnStart. The timer would then raise events in your code 
//   periodically, at which time your service could do its monitoring. The 
//   other solution is to spawn a new thread to perform the main service 
//   functions, which is demonstrated in this code sample.
//
void CSampleService::OnStart(DWORD dwArgc, LPWSTR *lpszArgv)
{
    // Log a service start message to the Application log.
    WriteEventLogEntry(L"CppWindowsService in OnStart", 
        EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE);

}


//
//   FUNCTION: CSampleService::ServiceWorkerThread(void)
//
//   PURPOSE: The method performs the main function of the service. It runs 
//   on a thread pool worker thread.
//
void CSampleService::ServiceWorkerThread(void)
{
}


//
//   FUNCTION: CSampleService::OnStop(void)
//
//   PURPOSE: The function is executed when a Stop command is sent to the 
//   service by SCM. It specifies actions to take when a service stops 
//   running. In this code sample, OnStop logs a service-stop message to the 
//   Application log, and waits for the finish of the main service function.
//
//   COMMENTS:
//   Be sure to periodically call ReportServiceStatus() with 
//   SERVICE_STOP_PENDING if the procedure is going to take long time. 
//
void CSampleService::OnStop()
{
    // Log a service stop message to the Application log.
    WriteEventLogEntry(L"CppWindowsService in OnStop", 
        EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE);
